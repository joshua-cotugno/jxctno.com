            When I was young, I was adamant to become a train driver, I never knew I would end up pursuing a career in the music industry. In 2019 my school won a set of ukuleles; I was given one to try out and I started to borrow one that my grandad had brought but was using rarely.  I was so taken by the Ukulele that I got one for Christmas, and as they say "the rest is history". Once lockdown had ended I started my band with some other students and we quickly became the go-to for anything musical at school – we played at school concerts, open evenings, awards nights, and assemblies, and formed much of the pit band for the last two school plays. It was a fun experience and gave me my first real music performance, though I had to spend no small period on transcribing out the bass music into TAB using Musescore, it was fun, and it furthered my understanding of standard notation. By then, I was an accomplished enough guitarist to play guitar for Billy Elliot – this was a massive challenge for me - it was the most complex music I had seen before and required hours of practice to get to a show-worthy standard. Overall, it was a success and I went on to play guitar again for Fame in year 13, in which I challenged myself by tabbing out only the main lead lines and spent longer practising with my teacher to decipher the sheet music for the other parts. This prompted me to run my own club from December to March in a performance of a scene from School of Rock', of which I arranged the casting, scripting and music, and this will be on my portfolio website www.jxctno.page in March. Through these experiences, I realised my love for music, and this was the path I wanted to follow. For my GCSEs, I studied music and even though I was almost exclusively self-taught I scored an A on my performance exam. Throughout my school career I have experimented with different ways to write music, scoring sheet music in Musescore, to recording multi track pieces in Reaper. Through this, I have gained an in-depth knowledge of different DAWs and have techniques to speed up my process. For my EPQ I decided to write a single, but all I had to use was a mid-tier laptop, or GarageBand at school. GarageBand would have been my first option since I am familiar with its UI and used it for my GCSE piece but since I could only access it from school, I turned to my knowledge of computers, and my other hobby: Linux. My knowledge of physics also helped me grasp music in a unique way – one of my favourite topics in the syllabus was soundwaves and in year 13 completed a presentation on the capacitors in music, but I researched all the other inner workings to develop wider knowledge. This gave me scientific context on exactly what happens when I play guitar, and a behind-the-scenes view on my own instrument, paving the way for me being able to successfully repair both my own guitar and the school’s stock, returning it to working order. When doing my A Levels I got an in-depth knowledge into areas of music to which I don’t really explore, from the logical, computer-code-like syntax of Bach’s chorales, to the beautiful, unearthly melodies on Debussy’s Pagodes, and the riot-inducing innovatory of Igor Stravinsky, which inspired me to visit the BBC Proms to see it in person. During Year 12 I also applied for the role of head student, experiencing something completely removed from anything I’ve done before. I went through a husting, pitching my ideas to the senior leadership team and the students alike. Through this I gained a valuable confidence boost from this, since I had to learn to speak to large crowds of people. I managed a diverse work load and work hard balancing my studies with two parttime jobs.  I work in the school’s canteen as a till operator and in a local churros and tapas shop where I work long days in the shop and gain yet another alternative perspective on music events when I work in the takeaway trailer. I was awarded my Silver Duke of Edinburgh Award in 2023. I used the opportunity to contribute to other’s musical development by volunteering in my school’s music department, sharing my ideas on which equipment could be good, and what equipment needs fixing, leading whole classes from Years 7 to 9 in activities, guiding GCSE students in their practical section and helping set up for countless events at school, whether that just is setting up a microphone for an assembly, to setting up the hall for my school’s Awards evening. I chose to develop my skills as a guitarist for the skills section, working towards Rock School’s Grade 6 in electric guitar with my guitar teacher. I’ve managed to accelerate my learning tenfold, improving my picking speed and accuracy so that I managed to get myself up to scratch. In Year 12 I did work experience at my local music venue, Club 85. I started by getting to know the venue and fixing one of the power amps, over the following days learning how to EQ the room with their sound desk. On the final day, I helped set up the venue for live band on-tour. I experienced music from a new viewpoint, as before I had only experienced it onstage and in the crowd. It was eye-opening to know how much goes on behind the scenes and furthered my interest in getting to understand more about the inner workings of the music industry.
